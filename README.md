This is a simple DC splitter providing 12V, 5V, 3.3V supply for breadboard. The project is built using KiCad.

## About dcSplitter:

The combinations that can be used are as:
1. 12V - 5V
2. 3.3V - 12V
3. 3.3V - 5V
4. 12V - 12V

## How To Use:
There are jumpers which you can use to connect a particular supply. Two jumpers should be used for higher current applications.
